# About
Hey everyone!

I’m a full stack software engineer and engineering leader with over 7 years of experience building scalable web applications, backend systems, and cloud infrastructure. I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, and MongoDB, with a strong track record of delivering reliable, user-focused software in fast-paced environments.

Throughout my career, I’ve led teams, architected full-stack solutions, and collaborated cross-functionally with product, design, and data teams to bring complex ideas to life. From optimizing backend APIs and containerized deployments to crafting responsive user interfaces, I bring both a big-picture mindset and hands-on technical expertise.

Much of my work has been in mission-driven industries, including healthcare and education, where performance, data integrity, and user experience are critical. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that scale thoughtfully with business growth.

I'm motivated by solving meaningful problems with great teams—and always looking for opportunities to build, learn, and contribute.

Outside of the office, I enjoy competitive fighting games, baseball, some coding challenges, and professional wrestling. Actually, I'm a professional wrestler myself. You can find me in the ring most weekends
throughout the year!
