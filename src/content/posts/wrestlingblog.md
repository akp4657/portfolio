# Wrestling Blog

Planned solo project

Tech Stack: 
- AngularJS
- NodeJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- MongoDB (House Posts)

In my spare time, I'm a professional wrestler (yes, really). I train in the evenings during the week and perform on shows throughout Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse, and even Ontrario on the weekend. There's
never really a dull moment when it comes to being in this activity. As such, I've been meaning to write down my experiences and thoughts as I go on this journey of violent dancing. Initially, I used Medium
to host the blog posts, but I feel I would have more freedom and retention with my intended audience if I build and host the website on my own.

There are a few ideas I have regarding formats, but I do know the main tech stack I want to use would be a MEAN stack. The project will likely start very soon. In fact, shortly after *this* website goes up, 
I'll probably be starting the wrestling blog!
